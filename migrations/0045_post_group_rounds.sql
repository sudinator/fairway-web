-- 0045_post_group_rounds.sql
-- When a TEE GROUP finishes, post a round for EVERY player in that group, not just
-- the person who tapped "Finish group". This matters for group scoring, where one
-- keeper enters everyone's scores: finishing the group previously wrote only the
-- keeper's own round (recordMyGameRound), so partners' rounds never landed in their
-- history until the game was formally ended (post_game_rounds) or they reopened it.
--
-- Mirrors the FIXED post_game_rounds (0026 + 0044) but: (a) scoped to a single
-- tee_group, and (b) callable by ANY member of the game (whoever is keeping score),
-- not just the organizer. Carries forward both 0044 fixes:
--   1) DATE: stamps the game's MATCH date (games.played_at), not its creation time.
--   2) RACE-SAFE: insert uses ON CONFLICT (game_id, user_id) DO UPDATE so a racing
--      client recordMyGameRound() insert (very likely when several players finish a
--      group at once) updates in place instead of throwing a unique-violation that
--      aborts the whole post. Requires the unique index from 0043 — run 0043 first.
-- SECURITY DEFINER so it can write other players' rounds (RLS otherwise restricts a
-- user to their own). Idempotent: one round per (game, user), updated in place.
